### Technologies Used:

Use "npm run start" to start up the server and client, or "nodemon run start" for continuous updates.

It is currently set up to send emails to GMail, so if you do not use this service, you will have to update the SMTP transport information in the app.js api routes. You can visit https://nodemailer.com/smtp/ for more information regarding set up. You'll also need to create a .env file to store your sensitive information.
